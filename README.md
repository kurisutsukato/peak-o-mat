About
==========

peak-o-mat is a data analysis and curve fitting program written in Python.  It
is especially designed to fit spectroscopic data but should be suited for any
other fitting task.  It allows for clearing, transforming, fitting, calibrating,
etc. of spectra with few mouse clicks.  peak-o-mat can easily be extended by
writing your own modules.  peak-o-mat has been tested on windows, linux and OSX.

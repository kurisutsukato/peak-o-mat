About
==========

peak-o-mat is a data analysis and curve fitting program written in 100% Python.  It
is especially designed to fit spectroscopic data but should be suited for any
other fitting task.  It allows for clearing, transforming, fitting, calibrating,
etc. of spectra with few mouse clicks.  peak-o-mat can easily be extended by
writing your own modules, it has been tested on windows, linux and OSX.

Getting started
=============

You need at least python 3.7 and the following packages:

- wxpython >= 4.2.1
- PyPubSub
- Pillow
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

All packages here above can be installed via pip, there is no need for any python package manager. Once all dependencies are installed, 
download the zip file (https://github.com/kurisutsukato/peak-o-mat/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and run `peak-o-mat-py`.

A big thank goes to Rubin Dunn. Without him devellopping and mainting wxPython for over 20 years now, peak-o-mat would not exist.

Change Log
==========

Changes from 1.1 to 1.1.1:

- problems with the decimal number format where solved which could have affected users
  with european locale settings
- moved the annotations tab to its own window
- added export option to write Excel files using pyExcelerator
  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyexcelerator). Per plot a worksheet will be created having
  one x column and one y column per set. The y-data is interpolated on the largest common
  x-range of all sets
- cosmetic bug fixes for the parameter grid
  
Changes from 1.0 to 1.1:

- changes to the opened project are detected and warning messages will be displayed
  when the user requested to close a modified project
- on windows, too, it is possible to select multiple sets within one plot
- added copying of sets and plots (ctrl-c/-v) within the same project and between
  different instances of peak-o-mat
- data->import reads multicolumn files including headers
- redesigned the datagrid:
  - the datgrid moved to its own window
  - the shell is shared among all instances of grids
  - when plotting from the datagrid, either the first column of the selection or
    column 0 can be used as x-axis.
  - pasting from external sources is more forgiving
- renamed start script from 'peak-o-mat' to peak-o-mat.py'
- only distribution types 'standalone' or  'source' will be offered from now on
- added 'winregistry.py' script to source distribution

Changes from 1.0rc10 to 1.0:

- liborigin became an independent package

Changes from 1.0rc9 to 1.0rc10:

- added support for reading graphs and spreadsheets from Origin project (OPJ)
  files through the inclusion of liborigin (http://sourceforge.net/projects/liborigin)
- significant improvements to mod_background

Changes from 1.0rc8 to 1.0rc9:

- better check for validity of general data operations, trafos are no longer
  attached to the sets when not passing the tests
- single component parameter picking added

Changes from 1.0rc7 to 1.0rc8:

- the data  grids are  now part  of the project  data and  thus stored  in the
  project file
- csv import of files with emtpy fields is working
- fixed an erroneous definition of *fwhm* in the GA function
- fixed a 'PyDeadObject' error issue 
- fixed installation failure on windows when installing from source

Changes from 1.0rc6 to 1.0rc7:

- compatibility bugs with python 2.5 were fixed

Changes from 1.0rc5 to 1.0rc6:

- replaced the Plex function scanner by re.Scanner which is much faster
- fixed the preformance problems with python2.5 

Changes from 1.0rc4 to 1.0rc5:

- the possibility to use custom models had silently vanished in 1.0rc4,
  restored

Changes from 1.0rc3 to 1.0rc4:

- since odr is finally included in scipy 0.5.2, there is no need to
  build the odr extension anymore - great!
- fixed a bug which caused loading from xrc to fail when installing the
  windows standalone exe
- improved error handling for user written functions
- improved shell interface of the datagrid (doc needs to be written)
- data files with more than two columns can be imported. Per extra column an
  additional set is created, all of them sharing the x-values.
- fixed a bug in the parameter picking routine which caused a markable slow
  down
- function strings are compiled before evaluation, slight speed gain 

Changes from 1.0rc2 to 1.0rc3:

- fixed a severe character encoding bug which made saving of the project
  impossible when using non-ascii filenames
- added mod_ruby: pressure calibration using the R1 luminescence

Changes from 1.0rc1 to 1.0rc2:

- new mod: mod_fuji
- the datagrid pages now include a python shell with special attributes which
  allow for accessing and modifying the grid data
- button bar was partially hidden, fixed
- peak-o-mat can be built as standalone executable on windows using p2yexe
  and innosetup - very cool

Changes from 0.99j to 1.0rc1:

- complete rewrite of most of the components according to a MVC design pattern
  This version should be more robust, faster and easier to extend.
  The changes however are too numerous to be mentioned here.

Changes from 0.99i to 0.99j:

- fixed a bug in the tree control which caused errors when dropping a tree
  item onto itself
- added basic printing and bitmap export by exposing the corresponding methods
  of wxPyPlot (ugly)
- added 'export all' menu item
- added an info box which shows the trafo history of each set
- the project data is now saved in its original unmodified state along with a
  list of applied transformations and a 'point deletion mask'
- added an annotation area
- new/open create a new instance of peak-o-mat, if the current project is not
  empty
- added experimental module mod_background, which will guess the background of
  a given set.
- fixed namespace issues for the 'set operation' control
- spreadsheet load does not any longer append an additional row if not of
  special type 'theGrid'

Changes from 0.99h to 0.99i:

- fixes in order to work with numpy 1.0rc1
- spreadsheet insert/delete debugged, now using numpy indexing tricks
- windows postinstall script deletes peak-o-mat batch script and desktop icon
  upon removal of the software

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

About
==========

peak-o-mat is a data analysis and curve fitting program written in Python.  It
is especially designed to fit spectroscopic data but should be suited for any
other fitting task.  It allows for clearing, transforming, fitting, calibrating,
etc. of spectra with few mouse clicks.  peak-o-mat can easily be extended by
writing your own modules.  It is developed on OSX, windows and linux but should
run on any other platform for which python and the extension modules listed
below are available.

If you find peak-o-mat useful consider to make a `donation

What's new in 1.1.9
-------------------

- Some bugs related to the datagrid have been fixed.
- The data import to the datagrid has been improved, peak-o-mat tries to me smart about the floating point character.
